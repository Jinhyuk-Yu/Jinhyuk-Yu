# MS Thesis Description
Name: Implementation of path tracking algorithms and trajectory optimization based on the extended Kalman filter
Experiments: Simulation the ackermann bicycle steering based vehicle on the planned path created by spline math code at MATLAB. 
Compare the result between when the filter is adjusted and is not adjusted.
